UnactivatedTweaker is a piece of software coded in the Python programming language which consists of an ensemble of tweaks you can use on your unactivated Windows 10 installation. In other words, you can use this program to set some settings that are restricted when unactivated, for example, personalization options, etc.

This software is still under active development, you can get the installation EXE file in the Releases tab soon enough.
