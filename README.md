# UnactivatedTweakerTUI
##### Icon by ZAF Design Std.

this is a piece of software coded in the Python programming language which consists of an ensemble of tweaks you can use on your unactivated Windows 10 (or maybe 11) installation. 

This software is still under active development, you can get the installation EXE file in the Releases tab soon enough.
