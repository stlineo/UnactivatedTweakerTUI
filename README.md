# UnactivatedTweakerTUI
##### Icon by ZAF Design Std.

this is a piece of software coded in the Python programming language which consists of an ensemble of tweaks you can use on your unactivated Windows 10 (or maybe 11) installation. 

This software is not under active development so dont expect any updates.

also first option doesnt work and i probably wont be fixing this stupid thing i made in the shortest amount of time possibleðŸ’€
